/**
 * <p> ModelSearchPosts Class </p>
 * 
 * <p> Description: This class serves as the Model component in the MVC architecture for
 * the Search Posts functionality. Currently implemented as a stub, this class is reserved
 * for future business logic and data management related to post searching operations that
 * are independent of the user interface. </p>
 * 
 * <p> Note: Similar to the guiAddRemoveRoles package, the search posts functionality
 * primarily uses static methods in the controller and direct database access, making a
 * separate model class optional in the current implementation. </p>
